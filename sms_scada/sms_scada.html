        <h3> Overview: </h3> <i>(This page is under construction...)</i>
        This SMS SCADA or text message based Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition was originally designed to act as a remote vehicle tracking platform that solved the issues existing market solutions struggled with. Communication range for my of the devices on the market were limited to a county-by-county basis in where RF transceivers had been installed. My design uses the cellular grid to exponentially increase the coverage for the device. Remotely the user can request a coordinate location and disable/enable the vehicle with a code. This is crucial for combatting vehicle theft where the user can disable there car without having to be inside such as the case in a car-jacking scenario. 
        
        Check out the code at on my GitHub Repository <a href="https://github.com/N-T-K/SMS-SCADA">SMS-SCADA</a> to see the code. I am in the process of compiling all the project information online.
